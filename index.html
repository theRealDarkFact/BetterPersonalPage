        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p> At the age of 7 I wrote my first text based RPG. By 15 I had developed my first game with friends and took
            the school, county and state science fairs with it.
            As I learned more about game design, development and programming I learned 6502 assembly language, basic on
            multiple systems, gw and basic A for PC, C#, C++, Ruby, Java,
            HTML, DHTML, HTML 5, php scripting, Visual basic 4 and 6. Between the science fair in 1989 and when I
            released
            my first commercial game in 2013 I also experimented with building a MMORPG in Visual Basic 6 using DirectX
            on PC.
            From 2013 to 2019 I released two commercial games to good reviews on both. The first Rofaxan 2089 AD stayed
            in the top 25 Xbox Live Indie games until the retirement of the platform.
            KerBang the second title is currently available on Windows 10 & Xbox one through the Windows store. Wanting
            to further hone my skills I went back to school at 45 and currently hold
            Dean's list and a 4.0 grade average and currently holding those same scores in the second semester.
            I am currently learning Blueprint visual programming for the Unreal Engine 4 and C++ while also using and
            learning more about C# and the Unity engine.
            Having worked with multiple engines on multiple platforms under all kinds of conditions I am extremely
            flexible with different workflows and able to manage myself or a team.
            All of my games have released within their intended release windows and currently the newest project at
            school is on time to follow this trend. I work well with others and push
            myself to keep evolving and learning more about my trade.
            Staying ahead of many of my peers in the process.
